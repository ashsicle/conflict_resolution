# conflict_resolution
Research project for the Spring 2019 Conflict Urbanism Puerto Rico seminar offered by Laura Kurgan and Frances Negron-Muntaner at Columbia University's Center for Spatial Research. The [Conflict Resolution](http://puerto-rico-now.c4sr.columbia.edu/2019/05/03/louie-serracoch.html) is one of several student research projects on the topic [Conflict Urbanism Puerto Rico Now](http://puerto-rico-now.c4sr.columbia.edu/2019/05/03/louie-serracoch.html).

Conflict Resolution investigates several datasets as layers within a decision model. Considering values that represent different demographic stakeholders, the decision model dissects how Hurricane Maria relief funds might be prioritized and distributed within Puerto Rico.

This project includes:
- Markdown, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Decision Model / Geospatial Analysis (GIS, ArcMap)
- Webmapping (Mapbox)
